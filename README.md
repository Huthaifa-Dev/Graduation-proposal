## Abstract
Image colorization is the process of taking an input grayscale (black and white) image and creating an output colorized image that represents the input's semantic colors and tones.
Previous image colorization methods either: relied heavily on human participation and annotation or Desaturated colorization was created. Instead, the unique technique we will employ here today is based on deep learning. We will use a Convolutional Neural Network that can colorize black and white photos and achieve state-of-the-art performance on many feature learning benchmarks.

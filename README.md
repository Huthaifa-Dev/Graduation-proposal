## Abstract

The current scholarship system is outdated; in this day and age, everything is easy to use and manage through
technology, making it more secure, efficient, and fast at the same time. However, aside from the cost of paper, it is
neither secure nor efficient to use between universities; what if it is damaged or lost for some reason?

## Introduction

Our suggested approach ensures the security and effectiveness of the university scholarship system. In the existing
method, you are required to write everything by hand, including a lot of repetitive information, such as information
connected to the recipient university or the scholarship itself, such as ID and kind, which should be given by the
university's database system. The current system requires the grantee university to provide a specific paper for the
scholarship, which is inconvenient for something so important (this paper is the only paper for that scholarship), and
if it is damaged or lost for any reason, the grantee university must provide another paper for the same scholarship,
which is time-consuming for the recipient university or the scholarship recipient.
